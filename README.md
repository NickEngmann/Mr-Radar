# Mr-Radar

Mr. Radar is a device used to detect the presence of a network switch on an open network port. Mr. Radar makes this determination while not setting off port security on the target switch.

If a switch is a present, it can detect if the switch is PoE compliant and what Mode of PoE is present.

Further setup and build instructions are forthcoming.
